PHILOSOPHY

Since a perfect program is impossible, compromises are necessary.
We prefer to solve compromises according to the following order:

(P1) The program works.
(P2) The results are precise.
(P3) The program is fast.
(P4) The code is modular.
(P5) The code is the simplest possible.
(P6) The code has the least amount of dependences possible.
(P7) The code is portable.
